# How I proceeded

## Try 1: Grids
I first tried inserting a main grid of 2 columns + nested grids in each column. But I had problems with automatically adjusting the height of the 2 main columns to the content. It resulted in the left column having extra space added between the nested grids in order to fit the content of the main right column. It was very frustrating because I managed to build the grid but got stuck at the very end of designing my CV. It took a while for me to understand how grids work, but it was probably not the best way for the kind of CV I wanted (or maybe I didn't find the right solution to solve my problem).

## Try 2: Bootstrap
Fucking awesome. No major problem encountered and so easy to use. I had a lot of fun!
